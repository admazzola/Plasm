Plasm AI
=====

An AI entity developed using OpenCV, intended to run on a high-end PC of the future.  Expected to run slowly and suboptimally otherwise.

Uses a graph of loosely-hierarchical linked 'nodes' (ideas) to organize data in deep-memory (hard-drive.) When a pattern is recognized on the 'video feed',
ideas matching that pattern will be brought into 'short-term memory' to make sense of the situation.
